## Week 3:

To build an interactive graph using plotly.

Dataset: we use the mtcars dataset. We will be plotting a box plot to visualize the hp variable for each of the different levels of the factor variable cyl. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```


## The plot
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x= ~cyl, y= ~hp, type = 'box', color= factor(mtcars$cyl))
```

## Thank You
